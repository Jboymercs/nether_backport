# Nether Backport
This is not it's own mod, bu0 a basis to easily copy from a start a new mod from without having to deal with the initial setup.
I am not really expecting anyone to find this useful other than me, but just in case here you go!
There is stuff for mixin, shading, and forge access transformers commented out in the buildscript, so if you want to use any of those just uncomment whatever necessary
Please replace anything named "modid" with the actual modid of the mod you are making.

This branch is for forge 1.12.2
