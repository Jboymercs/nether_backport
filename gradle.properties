# Base Versions
# The first 3 probably won't need to be changed again in 1.12.2.
# Good mod versioning is usually something like release.major.minor but if you release a hotfix or something you can do
# something like release.major.minor.hotfix. This is pretty subjective though so just do what feels best for you.

# Mixin
# This template assumes you will be using mixin. It might be better to get dependencies from the cleanroom maven,
# but using the Modrinth maven is more straightforward for general use case. Note that the actual mixin_version is
# just used for the annotation processor.



# Shaded Versions
# Add versions you want to shade using the Shadow plugin here. The cloning_version has been added here as an example
# of how to use the plugin. See dependecies section the build.gradle for more information. You can remove this section
# if the Shadow plugin is not going to be used.
cloning_version=1.10.3


# Implementation Versions
# Add versions to things you want to depend on here. See the mixinbooter and runtime versions for how to add an
# implemented dependency.


# Compile Versions
# Add versions to things you need for your project to compile, but you don't necessarily need to depend on or run with
# them. This typically is only useful for larger projects or if you depend on a mod with optional dependencies.


# Runtime Versions
# I decided to include some general use case mods that are useful to have in a development environment. You can also
# use these as an example of how to depend on CurseForge mods.
# Caliper prints out statistics to log files when you run the game for things like regsitries, timings, and forge events.
